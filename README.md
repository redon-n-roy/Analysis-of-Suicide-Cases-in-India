* Get everything up and runninng.
* Connect to the system either through the webshell/OpenSSH/PuTTY.
* Upload all the required files into the local system or clone this repo.

## Usage

To run the hive queries, use the Hive shell

Once the data is loaded into hive, use the `spark-submit` command to run the python program in this repo or use `pyspark` to run each command/operations manually.
